# Encrypted Chrome

Chrome extension that encrypts text with AES-CBC cryptography. Just for fun.

# How do I use this extension?

First, clone this repo with (install git if you don't have it already)
```
git clone https://github.com/robertobetini/encrypted-chrome
```

Then you must open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` at the address bar. You'll see a list of every extension you have.
To add a extension from local source, you must turn developer mode on the extensions page, then click "Load unpacked".
Search for the directory you have cloned then select it and flag the extension to on.
